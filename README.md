One of the coolest parts about building machine learning models is being able to share them with others so they know what you have accomplished. This is exactly why we should learn how to deploy our models, so anyone can interact with them through a nice user interface.

## Prototyping 
A prototype is part of a more global process for creating a new service, product, process or organisational model, or anything that cannot be produced without iteration.

I had to provid more graphics to show the power of dynamic analysis

Let's make an other plot with bars and display the resulat

After cleaning our Dataset and training the modele , this the result of the predictions prices car

## What is PyScript
PyScript is a framework that allows users to create applications in the browser using HTML’s interface. Using Python, with or without JavaScript, you can build interactive websites that don’t necessarily have to communicate with a server. Python web apps built using frameworks like Django and Flask are server based where the front-end is created in HTML and Javascript while the back end is Python running on a remote server. PyScript uses HTML to construct the user interface but Javascript is replaced with Python.
