One of the coolest parts about building machine learning models is being able to share them with others so they know what you have accomplished. This is exactly why we should learn how to deploy our models, so anyone can interact with them through a nice user interface.

## Prototyping meaning 
A prototype is a draft version of a product that allows you to explore your ideas and show the intention behind a feature or the overall design concept to users before investing time and money into development. A prototype can be anything from paper drawings (low-fidelity) to something that allows click-through of a few pieces of content to a fully functioning site (high-fidelity).
